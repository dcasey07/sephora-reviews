       "0  I use this with the Nudestix “Citrus Clean Balm & Make-Up Melt“ to double cleanse and it has completely changed my skin (for the better). The make-up melt is oil based and removes all of your makeup super easily. I follow-up with this water based cleanser, and I also use this just by itself when I’m not wearing make-up. It leaves the skin gently cleansed, but without stripping the skin. 10/10 ...   \n",

I get so excited to get into bed and apply this lip mask. I do see a difference because I suffer from dry cracked lips. I drink a lot of water and apply lip balm daily but nothing helped until I started using this. untiluntistafted usinf this.   \n",
